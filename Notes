KUBERNETES CORE CONCEPTS:
========================
		Lets take  1000 feet about kubernetes cluster 
Cargo Ship - > carrying all containers
Control ship -> responsible for monitoring, and managing the cargo ships   .

    Kubernetes cluster consists of set of nodes , which may be physical, or virtual ,on premise -> host applicaton in the form of containers

    But somebody needs load the containers on the ship, not just load, plean how to load and where to load, identify the right ships , store 
    information about the ships, monitor,track the location of containers on the ships,managing the whole loading process etc.This is done 
    by control ship.

    Control ship --> Host different offices and departments
	1) monitoring equipments
	2) commumuation equipments
	3) cranes for moving containers between ships , etc,etc

There are many container are being loaded and unloaded from the ships on daily basis and so you need to maintain information about the different ships, what conatainers are in which ship and what time it was loaded ..etc...etc.All of these are stored in highly available key value
store, khonw as ETCD. 

When ships are arrves you load containers on them using cranes.The crenes identify the containers, that need to be placed on ships.It identifyies the right ships based on it size , its capacity, the number of containers already on the ship and any other conditions shuch as the 
destination of the ship,the type of containers it allowed to carry ..etc....ete...so those are schedulers in kubernetes cluster. so A 
scheduler identifies the right node to place a container on based on containers resource requirements, the worker node capacity or any other 
policy and constrains such as taints and tolerations or node affinity rules that are on them.

There are different offices:
===========================
	Operations Team  -> takes care of ship handling, traffic control,etc,they deal with issues related to dameges,
	Cargo team       -> takes care of containers, when container are dameged or destroied they make sure new containers are made available	      services office  -> They takes care of the IT communications between different ships 
	Controll Manager :
		Node controller - Responsible for onboarding new node on cluster,handling situvation where node become unavailable
		Replication controller -> ensure that the desired state of containers are running at all time in a replication group 	

	                  -> How they communicate with each other , one office can reach other office  kube API server is the primary management component of kubernetes . Kube API server is reponsible for orchestrating all operation in the cluster .
	OUR APPLICATIONS ARE IN THE FORM OF CONTAINERS,
	THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT FORM THE ENTIRE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON THE MASTER NODE COULD BE HOSTED IN THE FORM OF CONTAINERS . 	
	DNS SERVICE 
	NETWRKING SERVICE SOLUTONS CAN BE DEPLOYED IN THE FORM OF CONTAINERS

So we need softare that software can run and thats the container runtime engine. a popular one being Docker.

So docker needs to be installed on all the nodes including on master node 

Lets now turn our focus onto the cargo ship, Every ship has a captain, Captain is responsible for every activities on those ships, Here the 
captin of the ship is kubelet in kubernetes.

The kubelete is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster.it listens the instructions from kube-Api server and deployes and destroyes 
containers on the node as required.


KubeAPI-Server periodically fetches status report from the kubelet to monitor the status of the nodes and containers on them.

Communicatoin between the worker nodes can be enabled by kubeproxy service .


ETCD Cluster:
============
	Nodes
	Pods
	Config
	Secrets
	Accounts
	Roles
	Bindings
	Others
When you run kube Control get command is from the ETCD server, Every Change you make your cluster such as adding additional nodes, deploying
pods or replica sets are update in the ETCD server .
	Only once its updted in the ETCD server is the change considered to be complete. 

KUBE-API Server:
================
	Is the primary management component in kubernetes, 
	When you run kubectl utillity, the kubectl utility is in fact reaching to the kubeapi server, the kubeapi server first authenticate 
the request and validates it , then retrives the data from the etcd cluster and response back with the request information. 
	When you run # kubectl create pod --> The request is authenticated first ane then validated, in this case apiserver creates pod objectwithout assigning it to a node, updtes the information in the etcd server, and udpates the user that the pod has been created.
	Scheduler contineously monitors the APIServer and realise that there is a new pod with no node assigned, and schedular identifies the ritht node to place the new pod on and communicates that back to the   kube-API server . 
	The API-Server then updates the information in the etcd - cluster, The apiserver then passes the information to kubelet in the 
approperiate worker node, The kubelet then created the pod on the node and instruct the container runtime engine to deploy the application 
images. Once done the kubelet updates the status back to the API-Server and API-Server then updates the data back in the etcd cluster.

	Simillar pattern is followed every time a change is requested......!!

KUBE-Api   server is the center of all different tasks.that needs to be performed to make a change in the cluster.


KubeControlManager:
==================
	A controller is like an Office or department within the master Ship. 
	A controller is a process that continuously monitors the state of varies components within the system and work towards bringing the 
whole system to the desired functioning state.For example 
	The node-controller:
	--------------------> is reponsible for monitoring status of the nodes and takes necessary actions to keep the applicatoin running
The node controller checks the status of the nodes every 5 secounds that way the node controller montor the health of the nodes.
 
	if it stops receving hearbeat from the node , and the node is marked as unreachable but it wait for 40 secounds before macking it 
unreachable. After a node is marked unrachable it gives it five minutes to come back up .if it doesn't it removes the pods assigned to that 
node provision them on the healthy ones if the pods are part of repliaset.

	The Replication Controller:
	---------------------------> Its reposible for monitoring status of the replica-set and ensuring that the desired number of Pods are 
available at the all the times within the set. If a pods dies it creates another one

kube-scheduler:
=============== -----------> is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.Scheduler is Only Responsible for deciding which pod goes on which 
node, It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes. (Thats the job of kubelet], The scheduler only decides whih pod goes where.
