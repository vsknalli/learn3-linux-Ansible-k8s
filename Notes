1) Introduction:
================
	What is continuouse integration?
So developers, when they are working on a prodect development , will code,
build code,test it and push it to the centralized version control system.

write the code, build & test locally , if everything is good, push it to the CVCS.


MERGE THE CODE , NOT GET INTEGRATED--since the CI  comes. 

Developers-> VCS - > Fetch -> Build -> Test -> Notify -> Developers


2) Installing Tools in Jenkins:
===============================
	In Maven we need to install jdk-8 and in jenkins we need to install jdk-11
Before we start our job we need to make sure jdk-8 and maven in the jenkins.
Manage-jenkins-> GloablTool-Configuration -> ehck jdk and maven path
