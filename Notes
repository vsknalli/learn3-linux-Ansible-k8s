Introduction:
============
	What is continuouse integration and what problem does this solves ?
Developer when they are working on prodect development ...CODE ,,BUILD,,TEST & PUSH 
This is continuouse process.....This is happening many many times in a Day...!!! codes are get merged in Centralaized repository on regular
basis.

	Days pass...weeks pass...sometime even months pass......The code keep getting merged and then after some time the code together BUILD
& tested it generated lot of bugs , issues and conflicts..etc

	The problem occurs becsuse "THE CODE IS MERGED BUT NOT INTEGRATED" so code merged from long time When build through conflict, Bugs 
and Errors .  All these conflicts, errors need to be resolved , which needs very long time that halts development.
